# Basic AI Model

**BasicAIModel** is a beginner-friendly project designed to introduce you to the fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). This project demonstrates how to build and train a simple neural network to classify handwritten digits using the popular MNIST dataset.

## Features
- A straightforward implementation of an AI model for beginners.
- Uses TensorFlow and Python for model creation.
- Includes data preprocessing, training, and evaluation.
- Visualizes the training process and results.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Python 3.7 or later
- pip (Python package installer)

### Libraries Used
Install the required libraries by running:
```bash
pip install tensorflow matplotlib numpy
```

---

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BasicAIModel.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd BasicAIModel
   ```

---

## Usage

1. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python basic_ai_model.py
   ```

2. The script will:
   - Load the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits.
   - Normalize the data for better training performance.
   - Train a neural network to classify the digits.
   - Display the model's accuracy on test data.

3. After training, you'll see evaluation metrics and visualizations of the results.

---

## How It Works
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - The MNIST dataset is loaded and normalized to scale the pixel values to the range [0, 1].

2. **Model Architecture**:
   - Input Layer: Flattens 28x28 pixel images into a 1D array.
   - Hidden Layer: Dense layer with 128 neurons and ReLU activation.
   - Output Layer: Dense layer with 10 neurons and softmax activation.

3. **Training**:
   - The model is trained for 5 epochs using the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical crossentropy loss.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - The model is tested on unseen data, and its accuracy is displayed.

---

## Example Output
After running the script, you might see:
```
Epoch 1/5
60000/60000 [==============================] - 5s 89us/step - loss: 0.2563 - accuracy: 0.9268
...
Test accuracy: 0.97
```

---

## Future Enhancements
- Implementing more complex neural network architectures.
- Testing the model on different datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10, Fashion MNIST).
- Deploying the model as a web application using Flask or Streamlit.
